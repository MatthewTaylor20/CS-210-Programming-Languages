# CS-210-Programming-Languages

**1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:**

This project allows the user to upload a list of items purchaced and it will calculate how many times each item was purchased. It will save that data in a dat file and will also allow the user to view the data in a few different ways. 

**2. What did you do particularly well?**

I think that in this project I did particularly well in implementing OOP principles in creating my GroceryList class and implementing the functionality of the application through that app. 

**3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**

I could definitely add more input validation. I have some input validation and a really small amount of error handling, but the error handling could be done much more efficiently, and the program could account for many more possible input errors. 

**4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**

The hardest part of this project for me was that I had written the entire program before realizing that one of the requirements of the assignment was to make sure I was using at least one class. Trying to rework the code to function the same way from the user's perspective while restructuring everything into a class was challenging. Becaus the program was relatively simple, it was difficult for me to see any need for a class. 

**5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**

I think that the time that I had to spend to convert my working program to one that embraced the use of the class is something that I will definitely need to be doing more in the future. 

**6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

Again I think that the use of the class and the way that that breaks up the code into different files and functions is much more maintainable if I were to continue to add additional functionality to the program. The more robust the program becomes, the more important that organization becomes.
